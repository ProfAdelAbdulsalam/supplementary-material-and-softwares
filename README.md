Summary: This supplementary material and softwares supports our study titled "Income-Based Analysis of Health Security in Western Asia through an Integrated GHSI, MCDM, and Clustering Model." 

1. The first file (document) is divided into four primary sections. It begins by outlining the key health security criteria used to evaluate countries: prevention, detection and reporting, rapid response, health system adequacy, commitment to international norms, and overall risk environment. These criteria were applied to decision matrices for 2019 and 2021. This section also includes the development of matrices that determine the weights of the health security criteria, rank countries, and group them by performance. Comprehensive scores are presented for different income groups, including high-income (HIC), upper-middle-income (UMC), lower-middle-income (LMC), and low-income (LIC) countries. The second section details the results of the D-CRITIC calculations used to establish the relative importance of health security indicators for Western Asian nations, broken down by income category (LIC, LMC, UMC, HIC) for both 2019 and 2021. The third section explores the application of the D-CRITIC-CoCoSo model in ranking the health security performance of these countries for the same years. It includes normalized values, weighted comparability sequences, and final rankings that highlight the changes over time. The final section presents the clustering analysis, which segments countries based on their health security performance scores derived from the D-CRITIC-CoCoSo model. This analysis identified distinct performance clusters and assigned grades, showing the distribution of countries across income levels in both years.

2. Supplementary Software 1 ( Distance Correlation-based CRITIC software for determining the  lative importance of health security indicators in WA): This tool is used to determine the relative importance of health security indicators for countries categorized by income groupsâ€”Low-Income Countries (LIC), Lower-Middle-Income Countries (LMC), Upper-Middle-Income Countries (UMC), and High-Income Countries (HIC). It provides insights for the years 2019 and 2021, with a specific focus on the Low-Income and Lower-Middle-Income Countries group.

3.Supplementary Software 2 (An Integrated GHSI, MCDM, and Clustering Model for Health Security Analysis in Western Asia): This software performs ranking analysis using a CoCoSo-based approach to evaluate the health security performance of these countries for 2019 and 2021. Additionally, it integrates weighting, ranking, clustering, and Spearman rank correlation analyses into a unified Excel-based tool. This comprehensive software offers a multi-dimensional framework for evaluating health security performance across all income groups.
